# Array flat
> Here are two functions `flatArray` and `flatArrayRecursive` that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4].

They both receive one argument, the array. Return value is a new (flattened) array.

Run tests with `npm test`, obviously you need to do `npm install` before that.
